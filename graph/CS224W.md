- Traditional methods: Graphlets, Graph Kernels
- Methods for node embeddings: DeepWalk, Node2Vec
- Graph Neural Networks: GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, Theory of GNNs
- Knowledge graphs and reasoning: TransE, BetaE
- Deep generative models for graphs

## Classic Graph ML Tasks

- Node Classification
- Link prediciton
- **Graph classification**
- Clustering

## Node Features

### Node Centrality

- Node centrality $C_v$ takes the node importance in a graph into account
  - Eigenvector centrality
  - Betweenness centrality
  - Closeness centrality

### Clustering Coefficient

- Measures how connected $v's$ neighboring nodes are:
  $$
  e_v=\frac{\textnormal{\#(edges among neighboring nodes)}}{\begin{pmatrix}k_v\\2\end{pmatrix}}\in[0,1]
  $$

### Graphlets

- Observation: Clustering coefficient counts the #(triangles) in the ego-network
  - **Graphlets**, i.e., #(pre-specified subgraphs): Rooted connected non-isomorphic subgraphs

#### Graphlet Degree Vector(GDV)

- A count vector of graphlets rooted at a given node
- Graphlet-base features for nodes
- node's local network topology

## Link Features

### Distance-based features:

- Uses the shortest path length between two nodes but does not capture how neighborhood overlaps.

### Local neighborhood overlap:

- Captures how many neighboring nodes are shared by two nodes.
- Becomes zero when no neighbor nodes are shared.

### Global neighborhood overlaps:

- Uses global graph structure to score two nodes.
- Katz index counts #paths of all lengths between two nodes.

## Graph Features & Kernel

### Graphlet Kernel

- Graph is represented as **Bag-of-graphlets**
- **Computationally expensive**

### Weifeiler-Lehman Kernel

- Apply K-step color refinement algorithm to enrich node colors
  - Different colors capture different K-hop neighborhood structures
- Graph is represented as **Bag-of-colors**
- **Computationally efficient**
- Closely related to Graph Neural Network

## Node Embeddings

### Random Walk Approaches for Node Embeddings

- Embed nodes so that distances in embedding space reflect node similarities in the original network

## Graph Embeddings

### Encoder-decoder framework

- Encoder: embedding lookup
- Decoder: predict score based on embedding to match node similarity

### Node similarity measuer: (biased) random walk

- Examples: DeepWalk, Node2Vec

### Extension to Graph embedding: Node embedding aggregation and Anonymous Walk Embeddings
